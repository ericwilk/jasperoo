= Introduction =
Jasperoo is designed to behave like any other Spring Roo addon. After adding it to the OSGI list, just call *jasperoo setup* and *jasperoo add* to create your first Jasper Report.


= Details =
== Installation ==
1. If you have already installed a previous version of jasperoo, remove it first with:
{{{
addon remove --bundleSymbolicName ca.digitalface.jasperoo
}}}
2. Install and start the jasperoo with:
{{{
osgi start --url http://s.digitalface.ca/jasperoo-latest
}}}

== Setup ==
Setup jasperoo with:
{{{
jasperoo setup
}}}

== Add ==
Here we will assume that you are working with the Petclinic example. If you want to follow along, enter create a new roo workspace and run:
{{{
script --file clinic.roo
jasperoo setup
}}}

Default is to add a report for an entity in the "~.domain" package with a Controller in the "~.web" package.
{{{
jasperoo add --type ~.domain.Owner
}}}

Alternatively, you could enable reports for all Roo entities in the host project with the following:
{{{
jasperoo all
}}}
