= Introduction =

Jasperoo has build-in support for *csv*, *html*, *odt*, *xml*, and *rtf* formats. All that is required is either creating a link to the desired report, or modifying the *menu.jspx* file as needed.

= Details =
== Links ==
The reports generated by jasperoo are all based on the following syntax:
{{{
[PROJECT ROOT]/reports/[LOWER CASE ENTITY NAME]List/[FORMAT]
}}}
So, the pdf formatted List report for the Owner can be found at:
{{{
http://localhost:8080/petclinic/reports/ownerList/pdf
}}}
while the odt version can be found at:
{{{
http://localhost:8080/petclinic/reports/ownerList/odt
}}}

== Menu Changes ==
Look for the following section in */src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/views/menu.jspx*:
{{{
<menu:category id="c_reports">
    <menu:item id="i_owner_list_pdf" messageCode="global_menu_list" url="/reports/ownerList/pdf"/>
    <menu:item id="i_owner_list_xls" messageCode="global_menu_list" url="/reports/ownerList/xls"/>
</menu:category>
}}}
And either modify a *menu:item* tag, or add a new one.

Don't forget to modify the */src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/i18n/application.properties* to reflect the new menu labels.
