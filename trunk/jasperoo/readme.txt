Welcome to my jasperoo!

The purpose of this addon is to facilitate the integration of Jasper Reports in Spring Roo projects.

This will provide you with the most basic of report templates. You will still need to edit these to show what you want.  I recommend iReport(http://jasperforge.org/projects/ireport) for this task.

This will not do all the work for you, just configure your roo project to get it ready for your report writting.
